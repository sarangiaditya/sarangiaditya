I am Aditya Sarangi from [Baripada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baripada), India. I have worked in the non-profit space previously. I can speak in 4 human languages proficiently and 2 computer languages in the intermediate level.

**TL;DR** I am not a cookie cutter candidate for this job. The skills that I have acquired through my education, curiosity and work experience would make me a tight fight for the role. This role marries the best of both worlds I love, technology and helping humans navigate technology. I strongly relate to the philosophy of Plausible in the areas of work, growth and customer support.

This is a summary of how I got here. 

1. Ordered list
{:toc}

## Education in Past Life
### Life leading to college (till 2016)
My parents brought me a computer when I was 6 years old. I played games largely. A new world opened up when I discovered that computers could be instructed.

### Undergraduate Degree (2016-19)
I studied Sociology at [Ravenshaw University](https://ravenshawuniversity.ac.in/). This built the foundation for dealing with open ended question and arguing for most suitable answer. 

### Master's Degree (2019-21)
I further deepened my roots in Sociology by pursuing a Master's degree in Sociology at [University of Hyderabad](https://uohyd.ac.in/). I learnt the nuts and bolts of quantitative and qualitative research.

## Work in Past Life
### Kalinga Kusum Foundation (October 2016- January 2017)
[It](http://kalingakusum.org/index.php) was an NGO working in the area of Child rights. I was a part of the team which heard the children's issues, and initiated action from the government's end. I created blog posts, social media posts and posters for this.

### Research Assistant for Member of Indian Parliament (December 2017- March 2018)
I supported Mr.[Gaurav Gogoi](https://gauravgogoi.org/), a politician belonging to the opposition party, with research to question the government in power with regards to the various policies. I can find flaws with other web analytics tools.

### Singrauli District Administration (April 2018- August 2018)
[This](https://singrauli.nic.in/en/) involved working in the grassroots levels of governance. For context, India is a country of 1.3 billion people. The government's welfare measures did not reach the citizens in the last mile. My job involved going close to them, understanding their concerns, and navigating the bureaucracy and technology on their behalf so that they get their welfare entitlements. This initiative impacted close to 3000 people. 

### SOS for Migrant Workers during First Wave of COVID-19 (March 2020- April 2020)
[Migrant labour crisis](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/india-coronavirus-lockdown-migrant-workers/2020/03/27/a62df166-6f7d-11ea-a156-0048b62cdb51_story.html) was an outcome of the first COVID wave. I was a volunteer in a helpine co-ordinating help for them. 

### SOS for Second COVID wave in India (March 2021- May 2021)
The second COVID was fatal in the number of infections and deaths. I volunteered in a helpline to arrange hospital beds, and oxygen cylinders.

### Freelancing (November 2021- Present)
Taking my time to upskill myself in technology particularly in data analytics area. I am also transcribing podcasts for a living.

## What I can bring to Plausible?
### Trouble Shooting
All of my previous roles involved helping people in difficult situations navigate through complex system. The trust that customers put on plausible is important. I will ensure that people get timely and friendly support. 
### Audience Engagement
Sales and Marketing in survelliance capitalism is noisy. I resonate with plausible's value of being transparent, and earning trust of potential customers. I can write blogposts, and find forums to engage with the community who would be the prospective customer of plausible. I believe in going slow and making things.
### Being Resourceful and Frugal
Most of my previous workplaces were resource starved. It required me to be frugal and creative. I learnt to figure problems in my own and find out more creative ways to reach the goals. I would bring the same attributes to Plausible. 
### Filling in the gaps and expanding other activities
There is not mention of [Yandex](https://metrica.yandex.com/about) [here](https://plausible.io/blog/best-wordpress-analytics-plugins). I can write cover the missing component of this. I would reach out to the niche communities to get Plausible featured. For the short term, I would reach to podcast hosts to feature plausible. In the medium term, I can start in house podcast to reflect on the larger values that plausible stands for.
### Technical Documentation
I have been using FOSS since 2016. This has given me the liberty to tinker and made me more aware of technical things. I can convey complex technical things in a lucid manner.
### Fire-fighting 
Things broke down in unexpected times in my previous roles. When things break down, I would do whatever it takes to restore them. 
### Manager of one and generalist at heart
My previous work experience has largely been in unstructured environments. In that sense, I am self directed at work and can work without minimal supervision. Being curious is related to being generalist at heart. This has let me to understand different disciplines and develop complementary skills.
## Endnotes
Thank you for reading till here. I hope that I have been successful in conveying about myself, where I come from and what I bring to plausible.

**TL;DR**, I am Aditya Sarangi from [Baripada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baripada),India. I have a Master's degree in Sociology. I have worked in the non-profit space previously. In the current moment I was learning advance data analytics to help organizations make more precise decisions and earn a little more salary. I can speak in 4 human languages proficiently and 2 computer languages in the intermediate level. I am not a cookie cutter candidate for this job. The skills that I have acquired through my education, curiosity and work experience would make me a tight fight for the role. This role marries the best of both worlds I love, helping humans navigate technology.

This is divided into different sections. Please feel free to skip around. 

Keeping ears close to the customer and helping them navigate the system. 

Learning full stack web development. Use technologies to solve a fundamental human problem. Creativity is in combining the two things which look previously unrelated.Â 

I can understand and comprehend the Github repos.

**Past lives**
Studied social science at college, particularly sociology. Increased my skills to handle open ended questions and find the most suitable answer for them. This also had critical thinking skills. It would be useful when I compare with the other companies thinking selling web analytics.

Part of the curriculum was understanding the quantitative and qualitative research. Quantitative matrices help you understand which source is driving the traffic to website. Qualitative analysis help you understand the person behind the matrices. Help me understand the medium and analyse sources to drive organic traffic to the website. 

First job was working for a NGO working in the area of child rights. Acted as a glue who conveyed the concerns of children to the legislators to make relevant. Children were the first clients who had their concerns relayed to the legislators. I was part of team which also involved in advocacy. So, I would create blog posts, social media posts and posters to relay their concerns.

Second job was providing research support to the opposition politician in the Indian parliament. My research work involved finding flaws in the policies of the current government. I can find flaws with other companies selling web analytics and convey them in blogposts.

Third job involved working in the grassroots levels of governance. For context, India is a country of 1.3 billion people. The government's welfare measures did not reach the last mile. My job involved going close to them, understanding their concerns, and navigating the bureaucracy on their behalf so that they get their welfare entitlements. This initiative impacted close to 3000 people. 

Volunteer with the in COVID helpline for the migrant workers. I was part of the team of volunteer who attended calls from distressed people and ensure that help reached them in time. 

Fourth job involved working closely with the small farmers in India. I worked for startup in India which was selling greenhouses to the small farmers. For context, India has 50% of its population working in agriculture. It involved addressing the concerns around the product and helping them use the product properly.

Taking a break. The past few years have been overwhelming. I was looking for a pivot in my career. I want to explore the technology side of it. Currently I am confused between learning full stack web development and data science. I understand the analytics part of the data. I understand HTML and Javascript which helps me in scraping website.

**FOSS Native**
Open source software is a part of my identity. I have been using FOSS tools since 2016. I usually experiment with linux distro in every couple of months. It will be a long list if I list them here, but I use FOSS for each of my needs. 

**Why Plausible ?**
**Values Transparency**- I did not notice any pretentiousness and tall promises in plausible. You are confident of the product, and you are talking to your competitors directly.
**Sustainability**- The idea of building a sustainable business without artificial marketing and VC money resonated with me.
**Customer First**- You are comfortable with the customers

**What I can bring to Plausible**? 
I have worked with multi-cultural teams and worked with people in hand holding them in the support system. For example help them use a particular app to register the details of the social security

My background in social sciences and using software tools will ensure that customers get a friendly and timely response. Ensure that product is getting the

I do not come from a conventional sales background where there is a mention of growth at any cost. My previous backgrounds have dealt with helping people to navigate the system more and win their trust. It was being transparent while selling your product. I would focus the existing customers get friendly response. Added to that I would seek to expand to engage with the customers in a particular way may be through humor, using pop culture analogies, ensure that indie outlets give adequate cover to plausible. Short goals is also getting the team members invited to podcast. In the medium term, I want to start a podcast for the company not just to know the technology behind it but also to understand worldview that the company shares. I firm believer of go slow and make things rather than go fast and break things.

Large systems or complex systems more efficiently. 

Accountability in doing the task. Being the FOSS native I am.

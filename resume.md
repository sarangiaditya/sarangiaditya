**TL;DR**, I am Aditya Sarangi from [Baripada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baripada),India. I have a Master's degree in Sociology. I have worked in the non-profit space previously. In the current moment I was learning advance data analytics to help organizations make more precise decisions and earn a little more salary. I can speak in 4 human languages proficiently and 2 computer languages in the intermediate level.

I am not a cookie cutter candidate for this job. The skills that I have acquired through my education, curiosity and work experience would make me a tight fight for the role. This role marries the best of both worlds I love, technology and helping humans navigate technology.

This resume summarizes how I got to where I am presently. It is divided into various sections please feel free to skip around.

## Education in Past Life
### Life leading to college (till 2016)
My parents brought me a computer when I was 6 years old. I played games largely. My new world opened up when I discovered that computers could be instructed.

### Undergraduate Degree (2016-19)
I studied Sociology at [Ravenshaw University](https://ravenshawuniversity.ac.in/). It exposed me to thinking in social science and different socio-economic divisions in society. The central tenet of social science deals with open ended question and arguing for most suitable answer. 

### Master's Degree (2019-21)
I further deepened my roots in Sociology by pursuing a Master's degree in Sociology at [University of Hyderabad](https://uohyd.ac.in/). I learnt the nuts and bolts of quantitative and qualitative research. This also deepened my understanding in other social sciences.

## Work in Past Life
### Kalinga Kusum Foundation (October 2016- January 2017)
[It](http://kalingakusum.org/index.php) was an NGO working in the area of Child rights. I was a part of the team which heard the children's issues, and initiated action from the government's end. I created blog posts, social media posts and posters for this.

### Research Assistant for Member of Indian Parliament (December 2017- March 2018)
I supported Mr.[Gaurav Gogoi](https://gauravgogoi.org/), a politician belonging to the opposition party, with research to question the government in power with regards to the various policies. 

### Singrauli District Administration (April 2018- August 2018)
This involved working in the grassroots levels of governance. For context, India is a country of 1.3 billion people. The government's welfare measures did not reach the citizens in the last mile. My job involved going close to them, understanding their concerns, and navigating the bureaucracy and technology on their behalf so that they get their welfare entitlements. This initiative impacted close to 3000 people. 

### SOS for Migrant Workers during First Wave of COVID-19 (March 2020- April 2020)
[Migrant labour crisis](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/india-coronavirus-lockdown-migrant-workers/2020/03/27/a62df166-6f7d-11ea-a156-0048b62cdb51_story.html) was an outcome of the first COVID wave. I was a volunteer in a helpine co-ordinating help for them. 

### SOS for Second COVID wave in India (March 2021- May 2021)
The second COVID was fatal in the number of infections and deaths. I volunteered in a helpline to arrange hospital beds, and oxygen cylinders.

Part of the curriculum was understanding the quantitative and qualitative research. Quantitative matrices help you understand which source is driving the traffic to website. Qualitative analysis help you understand the person behind the matrices. Help me understand the medium and analyse sources to drive organic traffic to the website. 

First job was working for a NGO working in the area of child rights. Acted as a glue who conveyed the concerns of children to the legislators to make relevant. Children were the first clients who had their concerns relayed to the legislators. I was part of team which also involved in advocacy. So, I would create blog posts, social media posts and posters to relay their concerns.

Second job was providing research support to the opposition politician in the Indian parliament. My research work involved finding flaws in the policies of the current government. I can find flaws with other companies selling web analytics and convey them in blogposts.

This initiative impacted close to 3000 people. 

Volunteer with the in COVID helpline for the migrant workers. I was part of the team of volunteer who attended calls from distressed people and ensure that help reached them in time. 

Fourth job involved working closely with the small farmers in India. I worked for startup in India which was selling greenhouses to the small farmers. For context, India has 50% of its population working in agriculture. It involved addressing the concerns around the product and helping them use the product properly.

Taking a break. The past few years have been overwhelming. I was looking for a pivot in my career. I want to explore the technology side of it. Currently I am confused between learning full stack web development and data science. I understand the analytics part of the data. I understand HTML and Javascript which helps me in scraping website.

**FOSS Native**

I do not come from a conventional sales background where there is a mention of growth at any cost. My previous backgrounds have dealt with helping people to navigate the system more and win their trust. It was being transparent while selling your product.

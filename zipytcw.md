I am Aditya Sarangi from [Baripada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baripada), Odisha. Previously, I have worked in the non-profit space. I can speak in 4 human languages proficiently and 2 computer languages in the intermediate level. Outside work i read widely, cook and listen to Indian classical Music.

**TL;DR** Creativity generally is people using lessons from one field in another field in different ways. Skills that I have acquired through education, curiosity and work makes me a good fit for the role. I combine the best of both worlds, i.e, understanding of human behaviour and computers. I understand 'tech-bros' and feminism a deeper level. This role combines the two things I like, i.e , technology and communicating it to people. 

This is a summary of how I got here.

## Education
### Life leading to college (till 2016)
I saw a computer for the first time when I was 6 years old. A new world opened up when I discovered programming. 

### Undergraduate Degree (2016-19)
I studied Sociology at [Ravenshaw University](https://ravenshawuniversity.ac.in/). This built the foundation for dealing with open ended question and arguing for most suitable answer. 

### Master's Degree (2019-21)
I further deepened my roots in Sociology by pursuing a Master's degree in Sociology at [University of Hyderabad](https://uohyd.ac.in/). I learnt the nuts and bolts of quantitative and qualitative research. I got more familiar with Python, Javascript and R. 

### Continuing Education
The web is a good and confusing resource to make sense of the world. Currently, I am learning to penetrate my roots into technology to see what the hype is about.

## Previous Work
### Kalinga Kusum Foundation (October 2016- January 2017)
[This](http://kalingakusum.org/index.php) was an NGO working in the area of Child rights. I was a part of the team which heard the children's issues, and advocated action on the government's end. I created blog posts, social media posts and posters to get the message across to the audience.

### Research Assistant for Member of Indian Parliament (December 2017- March 2018)
I provided research support to Mr.[Gaurav Gogoi](https://gauravgogoi.org/), a politician belonging to the opposition party, to hold the government in power accountable for its policies. I attempted to write script in Python to get tweets of popular leaders. The code was way too buggy.

### Singrauli District Administration (April 2018- August 2018)
I worked for the government in the grassroots levels of governance. The government's welfare measures did not reach the citizens in the last mile. My job involved going close to these citizens, understanding their concerns, and navigating the bureaucracy and technology on their behalf so that they get their welfare entitlements. This initiative impacted close to 300 people. 

### SOS for Migrant Workers during First Wave of COVID-19 (March 2020- April 2020)
[Migrant labour crisis](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/india-coronavirus-lockdown-migrant-workers/2020/03/27/a62df166-6f7d-11ea-a156-0048b62cdb51_story.html) was an outcome of the first COVID wave. I was a volunteer in a helpine co-ordinating help for them. 

### SOS for Second COVID wave in India (March 2021- May 2021)
The [second COVID wave](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/20/opinion/india-covid-crisis.html) was fatal in the number of infections and deaths. I volunteered for a helpline to arrange hospital beds, and oxygen cylinders.

### Freelancing (November 2021- Present)
Currently, I am upskilling myself in data analytics field. I am also transcribing podcasts and providing research support for a living.

## What will I bring to Zippy?
### Trouble Shooting
Four out of five of my previous roles involved helping people in difficult situations navigate through complex system. The trust of customers on Plausible is important. I will ensure that customers get timely and friendly support. 
### Audience Engagement
Sales and Marketing in survelliance capitalism is noisy. I believe in going slow and making things. Plausible's value of being transparent, and earning trust of potential customers resonates with me. I can write blogposts and monitor social media platforms to engage with an audience.
### Filling in the gaps and expanding other activities
There is not mention of [Yandex](https://metrica.yandex.com/about) [here](https://plausible.io/blog/best-wordpress-analytics-plugins). I will cover up missing parts like this one. I would reach out to the niche communities to get Plausible featured. For the short term, I would reach to podcast hosts to feature Plausible. In the medium term, I can start in-house podcast to reflect on the larger values that plausible stands for.
### Technical Documentation
I have been using FOSS since 2016. This has given me the liberty to tinker, and made me more aware of technical things. I can convey complex technical things in a lucid manner in writing. I can write the technical documentation.
### Being Resourceful and Frugal
Most of my previous workplaces were resource starved. This trained me to be frugal and creative. I learnt to figure problems in my own and find creative ways to reach the solutions. I would bring these attributes to Plausible. 
### Fire-fighting 
Things broke down in unexpected ways and times in my previous roles. When things break down, I would do whatever it takes to restore them. 
### Manager of one and generalist at heart
My previous work experience has largely been in unstructured environments. This has trained me to be self directed and work with minimal supervision. I have been able to retain my childlike curiosity for most things. This has let me to understand different disciplines and develop complementary skills.
## Endnotes
Thank you for reading this far. I hope that I have been successful in conveying about myself, where I come from and what I bring to plausible.
